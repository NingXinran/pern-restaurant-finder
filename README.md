# Basic Restaurant Finder App

This is a basic restaurant finder app that I built to learn about the PERN stack (postgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js). It was done closely following the FreeCodeCamp tutorial with some minor changes in terms of implementation as a way to test my understanding of the code.

The tutorial is available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01rYl9T3BU.

### Features
The app supports basic CRUD operations. Specifically: creating a new restaurant with its location and price range indicated, updating the info of the restaurant, deleting the restaurant and viewing the details of the restaurant.

Within the details page there are also reviews of the restaurant. Each review contains an author, a rating from 1 to 5 stars, and the review body itself. Reviews can be added from within the review page.

### Screenshots
The styling of the page is very simple and was done using bootstrap.<img width="1007" alt="Screenshot 2023-02-14 at 9 57 49 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70146427/218759167-6d592d6f-239d-497b-a372-165bb4fb7893.png">

### Instructions to run app
This app is not meant to be run outside of my own computer as I have removed the .env file containing information pertaining to the postgres account.
